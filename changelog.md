- Added option to change lore burning method (`burn_lore_method` in the addon config):
  - DISABLE — Disables any lore manipulations on burn/erase.
  - REPLACE (default) — Replaces the whole lore with a string containing the song name on burn, and removes the lore completely on erase.
  - APPEND — Adds a new line to the end of the lore on burn, and removes the last line on erase.
- Fixed clicking with a custom disc into a stopped jukebox with a disc already inside would cause it to play track without actually inserting the disc.
- Fixed an IllegalStateException on ChunkUnloadEvent when using Folia [#92](https://github.com/plasmoapp/pv-addon-discs/issues/92).
- Added support for minecart with hopper. Pulling item from jukebox using minecart hopper stops the track.
