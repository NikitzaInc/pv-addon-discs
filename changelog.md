- Added option to change lore burning method (`burn_lore_method` in the addon config):
  - DISABLE — Disables any lore manipulations on burn/erase.
  - REPLACE (default) — Replaces the whole lore with a string containing the song name on burn, and removes the lore completely on erase.
  - APPEND — Adds a new line to the end of the lore on burn, and removes the last line on erase.
